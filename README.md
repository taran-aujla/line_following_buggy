# line_following_buggy
As an electronics and computer engineering student its the first and critical point that student should know and work upon electronic integrated projects 
This project is based upon 2 basic components
1)hardware
2)software
both of these components are imporrtant with respect to each other
hardware consist of many electronics components for example 2 dc motors ,leds ,arduino board, connecting wires,Transmitter,recievers and their subcomponents,ETC
software consist of different various types of softwares for arduino board and designing of (Rx) and (Tx)
eg-EAGLE | PCB Design And Electrical Schematic Software,ARDUINO software

PURPOSE--
the battery powered line following buggy follows the black line having  width approx to 1 inch which can basically be varied according to need without crashing only guided by the input code
